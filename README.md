# 👋 Hi, I’m @serkan-aicb

- 👀 I’m interested in decentralized systems, trustless protocols, and AI-driven infrastructure.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to abstract complexity in API architectures and streamline developer onboarding in Web3 ecosystems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on zero-to-one blockchain infrastructure projects, token utilities, and smart contract tooling — especially in the context of real-world applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serkanlab/) | contact@blockunitlab.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a full-stack Web3 MVP in 3 days — because "impossible" is just poor planning.
