👋 Hi, I’m Serkan

Focused on decentralized infrastructure, zero-knowledge systems, and privacy-preserving protocol design, with an emphasis on verifiable and trust-minimized architectures.

Work centers around building scalable ZK verification pipelines, modular protocol stacks, and developer-oriented APIs that bridge real-world data with cryptographic guarantees.

Open to collaboration on early-stage blockchain infrastructure, zero-knowledge proof systems, verifier networks, and smart contract tooling—particularly in domains where privacy, compliance, and real-world applicability are critical.
